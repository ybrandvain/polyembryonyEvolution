# polyembryonyEvolution

R code to simulate the evolution of polyembryony. 
Written by Yaniv Brandvain, Alex Harkness and Tanja Pyhajarvi
Accompanies Brandvain et al. *Reproductive compensation and selection among viable embryos drive the evolution of polyembryony* in press at the *American Naturalist*.

This git repository contains three key files for simulating the evolution of polyembryony.    
- `polyembryonyEvolution.R` allows for flexible simulation of the evolution of polyembryony.  
-  `processPoly.R` processes simulation results for further summarization and analysis.  
- `scaleUp.R` allows for replicated (parralelized) running of such simulation across parameter space.   

The data from these simulations are available on dryad DOI: xxx. and the code to make all figures in the manuscript from these simulations is available at Zenodo DOI: xxx.
